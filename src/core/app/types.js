/**
 * @typedef {object} path An OSA path object.
 *
 * When you need to interact with files, such as a document in TextEdit, you will need a path
 * object, not just a string with a path in it. You can use the Path constructor to instantiate
 * paths.
 *
 * @property {() => string} toString Get the string value of the Path.
